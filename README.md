# contrail-config-diff
Get Contrail / OpenStack configuration files and compare them against previous versions

## Introduction
Contrail is typically deployed via automated tools such as: juju, RHOSP, helm, ansible etc.  
Sometimes issues can happen on these platforms and bad config can be pushed out to the platform.  
Also planned work can happen that can break Contrail components.

Configuration is deployed in many different locations (hosts and files) so it can take time to find the issues.  
This script aims to solve some of those problems.  
It grabs configuration files from remote hosts and then diffs the files against previous versions.  
The script can be run before and after maintainance or regularly against a known good template to highlight problems.
The config can then be quickly corrected.

The script has 2 modes:
### 1) push config into a git repo.  
This can be used to track the changes to configuration state over time and be a store for a 'known good' 
working cofiguration.  It can also help pin point when changes occured and correlate them to changes in DC behaviour.
Typically the script would be executed in this mode via cron.
### 2) Execute before and after a planned work event.
Here configs are stored in plain text and a diff produced when the 'after' snapshot is captured.
It allows an operator to quickly assess if their change was successful or if anything unexpected has changed.

## Configuration
The script takes input from 2 yaml files, one documents the remote component IPs (controller, analytics, heat etc).  
The other documents the config files you are interested in.
The files are completely configurable but examples have been included in the repo.
As Contrail / Openstack configs are typically only root readable, the script obtains them via a 'sudo cat' over an ssh session.  
Currently the script only works if the uid used with SSH can passwordless sudo on the remote component servers.

If you want to generate the IPs yaml file from a 'juju status' you can do this automatically with the script.
Currently other deployment methods require the file to be generated manually.

** WARNING **   
Lots of the files that are obtained contain passwords (why they are only root readable on the remote systems).
The script chmods all files it creates to 600 and by default attempts obsfucate passwords but it has not been comprehensively audited.
That said it will only work from a system / user that has root access (via sudo) on the remote servers so a good security posture is already assumed for the system.


## Examples
Below contains some examples for how to run the script.  
For all options please see ```python3 contrail_config_diff.py -h```

### 1) Push Configs into a git repo
```
python ./contrail_config_diff.py unit_ips.yaml files_no_ssl.yaml -r test-repo
```
Above line will produce no output, std_err & std_out are redirected to ./logs
Typically you'd instantiate that in cron or via another automated execution mechanism

Configs will be outputted to ./repos/${repo_name}
Standard git CLI can then be used to track config state e.g.
```

Note '-g' can be used with both modes, it means the 'ips_file.yaml' will be auto generated from juju
